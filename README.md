A Pharmaceuticals Study of Anti-Cancer Drugs using Matplotlib

The analysis and reporting for this project used Pandas, Python, and Matplotlib to study anti-cancer drug testing. 

The following tasks were executed to arrive at the observations further below:
1.) Cleansed the data.
2.) Generated summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SE) of tumor volumes for the drug regimens
3.) Generated plots (bar, pie) to be used for sharing the analysis.
4.) Calculated quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determined if outliers existed for treatment regimens for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
5.) Generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for the four treatment regimens.
6.) Selected a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generated a line plot of turmor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
7.) Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
8.) Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.  Plotted
the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.

Using all generated figures and tables, identify 3 observations and insights that can be obtained from the data:                                                                            
1.) Treatment with Ramicane and Capomulin appear to be better than Ceftamin and Infubinol. More mice were 
    tested on these two drug regimens compared to the other regimens.                                                       
2.) Higher Mouse weight coorresponds to greater tumor volume size.                                                
3.) Gender balance was close, but not quite an even split.
