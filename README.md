Summary for Project

Observations and Insights
1.) Treatment with Ramicane and Capomulin appear to be better than Ceftamin and Infubinol. More mice were 
    tested on these two drug regimens compared to the other regimens.                                                       
2.) Higher Mouse weight coorresponds to greater tumor size.                                                
3.) Gender balance was close, but not quite an even split.
